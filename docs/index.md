## **Who am I?**

Hey there! I'm Khaled 👋, a software technical writer. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 2021. During my four-year journey in college, I focused on the software development track. **But when did technical writing come into the picture🤔?**

It all started after graduation with the "Google Solution Challenge" a global competition organized by Google. My graduation project team and I decided to participate, and our project managed to reach the top 10 out of over 820 projects from around the world!

As part of the competition, we had to provide detailed documentation to explain our project to the judges. This was my first real taste of technical writing. The feedback we received from our Google mentor, who was assigned to us by Google, was invaluable. It inspired me to dive deeper into the world of technical writing, and from that moment on, I knew I had found my calling. 🌟
