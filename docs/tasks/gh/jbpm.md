# **JBPM Guide**

## **What is JBPM?**

JBPM is a flexible business process management (BPM) suite that allows you to model, execute, and monitor business processes throughout their lifecycle. It provides a graphical interface for designing workflows, a runtime engine for executing processes, and tools for monitoring and analyzing process performance.

## **How to Create a New Process**

There are multiple ways to create a new process in jBPM:

### **Using the BPMN2 Graphical Editor**

1. Open your jBPM project in Eclipse.
2. Right-click on the directory where you want to store your process, select New, and then click File.
3. Name the file and save it with the `.bpmn` extension. This opens the BPMN editor.
4. Use drag-and-drop functionality to add nodes representing business logic, such as tasks, gateways, and events.

### **Defining Process Using XML**

1. Create a `.bpmn` XML file manually.
2. Define nodes and their properties in the upper part of the file, and graphical information in the lower part.

## **How to Create a Process Form**

Forms can be created automatically or manually in Business Central:

### **Generating Forms Automatically**

1. In Business Central, go to Menu > Design > Projects.
2. Open your project and select the business process name.
3. In the process designer, click on a task or process node.
4. Use the Form Generation icon in the toolbar to generate forms for the process or specific tasks.
5. Customize the generated forms using the Form Modeler.


### **Creating Forms Manually**

1. In Business Central, go to Menu > Design > Projects and click on your project name.
2. Select Add Asset > Form.
3. Provide details like form name, package name, and model type (e.g., Business Process or Data Object).
4. Use the Form Modeler to drag fields and controls onto the canvas.
5. Save your changes.

## **How to Deploy the Process**

Processes can be deployed using different methods:

### **Using Process Designer Tool**

1. Right-click on the process archive folder in your project.
2. Select the deployment option from the context menu.

### **Using Ant Task**

1. Define an Ant task for deployment using the following XML snippet:

```xml
<target name="deploy-process">
    <taskdef name="deployproc" classname="org.jbpm.ant.DeployProcessTask">
        <classpath location="jbpm-jpdl.jar" />
    </taskdef>
    <deployproc process="build/myprocess.par" />
</target>
```

2. Run this task to deploy your process.

### **Programmatically**

You can deploy processes programmatically using jBPM APIs:

1. Create a `ProcessDefinition` object from XML.
2. Use `JbpmContext.deployProcessDefinition(processDefinition)` to deploy it.

## **How to Test a Process in jBPM**

You can test processes programmatically using jBPM APIs:

1. Retrieve the process definition:

```java
GraphSession graphSession = jbpmContext.getGraphSession();
ProcessDefinition processDefinition = graphSession.findLatestProcessDefinition("processName");
```

2. Create a new instance of the process:

```java
ProcessInstance processInstance = new ProcessInstance(processDefinition);
Token token = processInstance.getRootToken();
token.signal(); // Start execution
```

3. Save or retrieve instances from the database:

```java
jbpmContext.save(processInstance);
```

4. Continue execution by signaling transitions:

```java
processInstance.signal();
assertTrue(processInstance.hasEnded());
```
