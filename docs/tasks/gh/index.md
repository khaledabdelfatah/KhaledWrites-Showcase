# **GH Task**

Hi there! ðŸ˜Š

Before diving in, here are a few quick notes to keep in mind:

This page was created as part of the "Governance House" task during the recruitment process for the technical writer position. Since the task description didnâ€™t provide specific details, I made a few assumptions to complete it. For example, I imagined the database might be about a library and tailored the content accordingly. Additionally, as the target audience wasnâ€™t specified, I kept the steps simple and included references for further exploration.

## Guides and Resources

Here are some helpful guides to explore:

1. **Document Management**  
    Access the [OpenKM Guide](./openkm.md) to learn about OpenKM, a document management system.

2. **Business Process Management**  
    Explore the [JBPM Guide](./jbpm.md) to understand jBPM, a business process management suite.

3. **Identity and Access Management**  
    Click on the [Keycloak Guide](./keycloak.md) to discover Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution.

4. **Database Management**  
    Learn about database management with the [Database Management Guide](./db_management.md).

5. **Java Class Diagram**  
    Check out the [Java Document Task](./java_docs.md) to view a sample class diagram for a library system.


!!! quote "Disclaimer"
    To be honest, this was my first time learning about "OpenKM" and "Keycloak." I explored their official documentation and other resources to understand them better and create this document for you.

I hope you find it helpful and easy to follow! ðŸ˜Š
