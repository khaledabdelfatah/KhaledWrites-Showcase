API Documentation 
This test is designed to assess your ability to create clear, concise, and accurate technical documentation for an API, specifically focusing on a recommendation engine API.
Scenario:

You are a technical writer for Z Corp., a company that develops recommendation engine software. You have been tasked with documenting the Z Recommendation Engine API, which allows developers to integrate personalized recommendations into their applications.

Task:

Using the provided API reference and sample code snippets, write a detailed user guide for the Recommendation Engine API. The user guide should be targeted towards developers with some experience in using APIs alongside business stakeholders

Specific Requirements:

Clarity and Conciseness: Present information clearly and concisely, avoiding unnecessary jargon.

Structure and Organization: Organize the user guide logically, with clear headings and subheadings.

Accuracy: Ensure all information is accurate and based on the provided API reference.

Style and Tone: Maintain a professional and objective tone throughout the documentation.

Completeness: Cover all essential aspects of the API v2, including:

Authentication and authorization methods with advanced token management techniques (e.g., refresh tokens).

Available API endpoints with detailed descriptions of their functionalities (Use the sample endpoints below as a reference):

Sample Endpoints:

/users/{user_id}/recommendations: Get personalized recommendations for a specific user, with options to filter by category, brand, or price range (use query parameters).

/items/{item_id}/similar_items: Get a list of similar items to a specific item, including a confidence score for each recommendation.

/categories/{category_id}/recommendations: Get recommendations for items in a specific category, with the ability to specify the number of recommendations returned.

/feedback: Send feedback on a recommendation (upvote/downvote) and optionally provide a reason for the feedback (POST request with JSON body).

/user-data/{user_id}/interactions: Manage user interaction data (e.g., views, purchases) to personalize recommendations. This endpoint supports various actions like creating, updating, and deleting interactions (use appropriate HTTP methods with JSON body).

/algorithms/{algorithm_id}/configure: Configure recommendation algorithms by adjusting parameters like weighting factors and collaborative filtering methods (PUT request with JSON body).

Request and response formats (including detailed data structures for JSON objects).

Error handling with comprehensive error codes and descriptions.

Advanced features like:

A /status endpoint for real-time API health checks.

Pagination support for retrieving large recommendation lists efficiently.

Caching mechanisms to optimize performance.

Code examples demonstrating usage of various functionalities (Include code snippets for at least 3 different endpoints).
