!!! info "Task Description"  
    Hi,

    Our hypothetical client has launched a Push-to-Talk (PTT) communication platform designed for instant voice communication in industries like security, logistics, and field operations. The platform allows users to communicate with individuals or groups in real-time, similar to a traditional two-way radio, but over a cloud-based network. 

    It‚Äôs important to have user documentation to help new customers understand and use the core PTT features effectively. 

    
    Your Tasks: 

    1- Write a step-by-step user guide for a feature of a Push-to-Talk (PTT) communication system (similar to mobiletornado.com). Assume the feature is ‚ÄúSetting Up & Using Group Calls‚Äù within the application.
    2- Convert a small section of your guide as if it were to be published on a webpage, use basic HTML to structure it. 
    3- Record a short voice note for a 1-minute explaining how to set it up.
